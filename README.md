# Spam Email Classification #

This project aims to classify emails as 'spam', given a 'bag of words' distribution of significant words. Data was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase)
Various classifier models, such as Random Forests and AdaBoost, are tuned and compared.

This project was part of an assignment for a machine learning course (SENG 474) at the University of Victoria. A report is also included to summarize results.
